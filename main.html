	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations it performs relative to the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is more efficient.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n).</p>
